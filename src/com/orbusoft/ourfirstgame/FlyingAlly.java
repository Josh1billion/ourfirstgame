	/*
	 * This class is the base class for all player pets of the flying type.
	 * It should contain algorithms for following the player in a manner which makes
	 * it appear as if the pet is flying after the player, much like Na'vi follows Link
	 * in ocarina of time, or a mosquito follows a person (i guess).
	 * It should not contain much more, though it might end up holding some code which is
	 * shared among all flying-type player pets.
	 * 
	 * Stuff like statistics (HP, strength, agility, etc.) should, as always, be coded
	 * within the class specific to the pet itself, as should any functions for stuff like
	 * special attacks or utility which is different from flying pet to flying pet.
